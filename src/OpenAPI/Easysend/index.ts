/**
 * ChatDaddy Easysend (Notifications) Service
 * Data Processing service to standardize & process data from individual parsers & services. ## Writing a service for ChatDaddy Easysend The job of a service is to parse and clean data from a given data source. If you are writing a parser for an e-commerce website -- your job is to simply extract the required parameters and send them to the EasySend service in the required format (more on the format later).  ## Incorporating the routes Easysend requires just the base url for each service. This can be  - http://abcd.com/api - http://xyz.com/ - etc. Appending to this base url, each service must incorporate the following routes in their app --  ### GET /easysend/schema \'This route is used by easysend to determine all the specifications of the service including:\'\' - the parameters the service can send - credentials required - an image - a description & name View the `ServiceModel` schema to know the exact specifications ### POST /easysend/{id} - This route is for registering a new tracking for a user.  - The `id` parameter is the ID of this tracking. - Service should keep the `id` parameter secret. - Body will be `application/json` encoded and have the following type: ``` ts     type Body = {         // the credentials the service required, specified by the aforementioned schema         credentials: { [_: string]: string }      } ``` - Service must check credentials & return a 400+ code if invalid - If the service returns a 200 code, it will be assumed that the tracking has been saved & validated successfully ### DELETE /easysend/{id} - This route is for deregistering the tracking specified by the `id` parameter in the path. ## Sending Events to Easysend - Easysend expects a JSON encoded body at `PATCH /event/{id}` where ID is the secret identifier of the tracking registered previously - This route is covered in this document along with the required schema [here](/#Events)
